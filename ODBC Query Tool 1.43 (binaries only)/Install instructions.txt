INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

ODBC Query Tool is a portable application; to begin using it, just extract all files from the downloaded archive into their own folder. These are the core files:

odbc_qry.exe (main executable)
odbc_qry.chm (help file)

To update an existing installation, just overwrite all old files with the new ones provided in the downloaded archive. The saved connection details will be preserved.

To run the application, just double click on the odbc_qry.exe file.

When the user saves some connection details for the first time, a new file, named "saved connections.ini" will be generated in the same folder as the main executable. This text file contains all saved connections' details.
